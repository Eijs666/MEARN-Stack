## Description

This project is a demonstration of my skills in full-stack web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes functionalities such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting books, showcasing both backend and frontend development capabilities.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for books
- Backend API built with Node.js and Express

- Frontend interface developed with React.js
- Utilization of Vite and Tailwind CSS for frontend styling
- Single Page Application (SPA) architecture with React Router DOM
- Enhanced user experience with modal dialogs and beautiful alerts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-folder>`
3. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
   - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
   - Run the server: `npm start`

2. Start the frontend development server:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
   - Run the development server: `npm start`

3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`
